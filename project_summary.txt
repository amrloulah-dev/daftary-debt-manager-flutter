# Fatora - Project Summary

## Project Overview
**Fatora** is a digital ledger application designed to help individuals and small businesses efficiently manage debts, credits, and payments. It serves as a modern replacement for traditional paper notebooks, allowing users to keep accurate track of money owed to them by customers, friends, or other contacts.

## The Problem It Solves
Keeping track of informal loans and credit sales on paper can be disorganized, leading to calculation errors, lost records, and forgotten debts. Fatora solves this by providing a structured, secure, and automated way to record every financial interaction.

## Who Is It For?
- **Small Business Owners:** Shopkeepers, freelancers, and service providers who offer credit to their clients.
- **Individuals:** Anyone who lends money to personal contacts and needs a reliable way to track repayment.

## Key Features
- **Debtor Management:** Users can create profiles for people who owe money, storing their contact details (name, phone, email) for easy communication.
- **Transaction Tracking:** The app records two main types of actions:
    - **Debts:** Detailed records of items or services provided on credit, including prices and quantities.
    - **Payments:** Records of money received, allowing for partial or full repayment tracking.
- **Financial Dashboard:** A main overview screen displays critical financial health metrics, such as:
    - Total money currently owed (Outstanding Debt).
    - Total money collected (Total Paid).
    - Number of active debtors.
- **Smart Analytics:**
    - **Risk Assessment:** Automatically categorizes debtors by risk level (e.g., Low, Medium, High) based on how much they owe.
    - **Status Tracking:** Identifies who is active, inactive, or fully paid off.
- **Search & Organization:** Users can easily find debtors by name or phone number and sort lists by debt amount or last payment date.
- **Cloud Security:** Data is synchronized securely online, ensuring records are safe even if the device is lost.
- **Accessibility:** The application supports both English and Arabic languages and offers Light and Dark visual themes.
